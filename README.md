# the_snake_game
This Python code implements the classic Snake game using Pygame. It features a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The snake wraps around the screen edges when it reaches the boundaries. User input controls the snake's direction, and the game ends if the snake collides with itself.
